Hello there!

These files represent my love for programming, a beautiful tool designed to help make our life's easier. The first project reflects,
my love for efficiency. My role was that of an IT Analyst, overlooking a network in a resort. We had an MDF with about 5 servers, 
20 virtual servers and quite a bit of switches. We also had about 10 or so IDF's, so no, this network was not small. The property itself was 
over 1000 sq ft. So sometimes, walking around to solve a problem took some time. I decided to use my experience of C# to create my 
own network monitor, independantly monitoring over 100 devices. Now, you may ask, there are already tools in place to do this exact thing.
Why reinvent the wheel? Well, the simple answer is this, third party software was a no-no in our env. So I asked nicely and was able
to work on this project to make my life easier.
