# C-Projects ((Beta) Network Monitor)
These are projects I myself coded, with the help of resources of course. 

TL;DR
Using internal tools such as the WMI namespace as well as some commands to the command line, this program uses OOP principles to 
create a list of network devices, which will tell me with a ping if they are reachable. Each device class allows me to RDP, Ping, 
connect to UNC path, restart, and Shutdown. Code writen by me, with extensive research and some code from online (such  as reading
in an interlop framework with Excel sheet).
